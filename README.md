# Analysis of Movie Box Office Success Factors

## **Introduction**
The dataset used for this analysis was sourced from Kaggle's *TMDB 5000 Movie Dataset*. The dataset contains movie data from 1916 to 2016.

## **Assumptions made about the data during DA:**
- The values in the **'budget'** and **'revenue'** columns are expressed in USD, representing global box office revenue.
- The analysis of actors/actresses considers their appearance in a movie across all roles, not just the main role.

## **Key Technologies Utilized:**
- **Pandas & Numpy:** For data analysis and manipulation
- **Abstract Syntax Tree (AST):** For parsing and processing data structures
- **Plotly:** For interactive data visualization

## **Key Questions Addressed in This Project:**
- **Trends in Film Industry:** Invested Budget and Box Office Revenue Over the Years
- **Analysis of the Top 10 Highest-Grossing Films**
- **Top 10 Films by Budget and Number of Votes**
- **The Most Successful Directors Based on Box Office Revenue**
- **The Most Successful Actors Based on Box Office Performance and Number of Films Appeared**
- **Insights into High-Grossing Genres**
- **Analysis of the Evolution of Popular Genres Over Time**
- **Seasonal Trends:** Are Certain Genres More Popular in Specific Months?
- **Exploring the Relationship Between a Film's Budget, Revenue, Vote Count, and Ratings**
- **Defining Key Characteristics of Films with High Returns on Investment (ROI)**
